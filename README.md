# Overview

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Tool is a comprehensive Python program designed to predict the classification of breast tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques. This tool utilizes a logistic regression model, allowing for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction based on user inputs.

# Features

- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and encodes the diagnosis column (Malignant as 1 and Benign as 0).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides descriptive statistics, visualizes the data distribution, and displays correlation heatmaps.
- Data Preprocessing: Scales the features and splits the dataset into training and test sets.
- Model Training: Implements a logistic regression model to classify tumors.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Displays a normalized confusion matrix.
- User Input Prediction: Allows user inputs to predict the classification of a tumor and displays the probabilities.
- Cross-Validation: Performs K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold, and Shuffle Split cross-validation to assess the model's stability and reliability.
